## Python Ray Tracer 
This repository contains a step-by-step, annotated implementation of a basic Ray Tracer in Python. The project leverages NumPy for calculations and Matplotlib for visualizing the results. The mathematical concepts behind the code, primarily Linear Algebra with some Calculus, are explored in detail.

### Project Structure
- **`Ray Tracer.ipynb`**: The main notebook, containing the core implementation of the ray tracer.
- **`Image Generation.ipynb`**: A supplementary notebook with code for generating images to visualize the mathematical concepts.

### This is the final result:
