## Python Ray Tracer 
This repo contains an implementation of a basic Ray Tracer in Python using Numpy for calculations and Matplotlib to visualize results. The mathematics behind the code (mostly Linear Algebra) is explored in detail. The main notebook for the project is Ray Tracer.ipynb, while the Image Generation.Ipynb notebook contains code for generating the images to visualize the math. This is the final result:
